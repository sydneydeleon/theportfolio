        <h2>Villager Personalities</h2>
        <p><br/></p>

        <div className="horizons-persona">

This page has a list of all the personalities found in Animal Crossing series. Every non playable character, or villager, in the series falls under one of 8 possible personality types.

</div>

<div className="horizons-personality">

    <h1>Cranky</h1>

    <p>Cranky villagers (コワイ) (also called Grumpy villagers), are male villagers in the Animal Crossing series. The name is a direct reference to the meaning of cranky; someone who is irritated or annoyed easily. As of now, there are 63 cranky villagers.<br/><br/>
    
    The cranky characters can seem quite bitter and out-of-touch with social trends, making them generally unpopular with the peppy villagers. They have the deepest voice of all the characters except Joan, and many have frowns on their faces.<br/><br/>

    They usually spend a small amount of their day in their houses, and most of the day out. They are very self-centered and often enjoy gossiping about lifestyles of other villagers, making them snobby as well as grouchy. They will act protective of the player when the player becomes friends with them and they will seem to disagree with most of the things that other villagers say.<br/><br/>
    
    They find it easy to get along with snooty, jock, and other cranky villagers, usually discussing trivial things such as food and the problems with unhealthy food. They find it difficult to get along with peppy, smug, and sisterly villagers, who cranky villagers claim are mucking around.

    <h1>Jock</h1>

    <p>Jock villagers (ハキハキ) (also called sporty) are male villagers in the Animal Crossing series. Hakihaki is a Japanese onomatopoeic or mimetic word meaning, briskly, promptly, clearly or lucidly. The English term Jock comes from the American stereotype, usually seen as high school or college jocks.<br/><br/>
    
    Jock villagers are obsessed with sports, talking frequently about their physical appearance and sporting progress and occasionally gossip. They brag quite a bit, usually about working out. They would encourage the player when given tasks and other things.
    
    <br/><br/>Stereotypically, they are also not very smart, incessantly confusing themselves - calling the brain "the Brian", saying they're in a "punch" instead of pinch and failing to even grasp the concept of the game 'rock, paper, scissors'. Also, they rarely talk about fashion, although they are very similar to snooty villagers.
    
    <br/><br/>They are the brother-like characters in the game, giving pep talks to the player and appearing competitive towards them and other villagers when they partake in town events
    </p>

<div className="horizons-personality">

    <h1>Lazy</h1>

    <p>Lazy villagers (ぼく) (sometimes called relaxed, doofus, or food-loving villagers) are male characters in the Animal Crossing series. The name refers to their calm, laid-back lifestyle as well as their hospitable nature and love of food. <br/><br/>
    
    Lazy villagers have a relaxed and easygoing approach to living in the town. They are generally friendly and hospitable when interacting with the player and other villagers, and they are fairly confident in themselves and their lifestyle.<br/><br/>

    They may mention reading an unseen magazine, called "Chillin' Magazine", which also reflects on their chilled, relaxed lifestyle. They often mention theories relating to certain aspects of the town, which they will mention in conversation to the player or other villagers. For example, some lazy villagers will wonder aloud who has to sit inside the Tom Nook Point System to make it talk.

<div className="horizons-personality">

    <h1>Normal</h1>

    <p>Normal villagers (普通) (sometimes called sweet or sweetie villagers) are female characters in the Animal Crossing series. The name comes from their neutral opinion on things such as hobbies and other characters such as the player, villagers, and special visitors. They are often kind to the player.<br/><br/>
    
    Normal villagers, despite being called "normal", have a lack of self-worth, where they feel self-depreciative. They also appear slightly obsessive with cleanliness and hygiene - a trait also found in peppy villagers. They do not, however, appear to show any concern for their physical appearance, making them happy with what they have. They talk about a friend called Moppina, a non-present mop which reflects on their clean-obsessive nature. They can also have a conversation with a peppy villager about Moppina, which the peppy villager may find funny. <br/><br/>

    They get along very well with every villager and will usually talk about other villagers, instead of talking about themselves and their problems. However, they will occasionally talk about themselves and their personal issues. If a normal villager stays in the player's town for a long period of time, she will get rid of all her furniture and when she does leave, she will announce to leave "empty-handed, and without anything."

<div className="horizons-personality">

    <h1>Peppy</h1>

    <p>Peppy villagers (アタイ) (sometimes called perky) are female characters in the Animal Crossing series. They are incessantly friendly and excitable, making them very quick to apologize for anything they regret doing, even if they had not done anything particularly wrong<br/><br/>
    
    Peppy villagers speak with chipper, bouncy voices and enjoy cheering when talking with player(s) and other villagers; they are rarely discouraged from doing anything. They come out of their homes often.<br/><br/>

    They are always excited to see the player. They have short attention spans and wild imaginations. They express a number of aspirations which they will often share with the player such as their numerous claims to stardom as a pop star or diva. <br/><br/>
    
    They have a tendency to say stereotypical valley girl words and phrases like "ohmigosh!!!" and "like" (as in, "That is, like, so cool!"). When they are describing certain things, they often use "SOOOO!" and "totally!" They commonly say a long, drawn-out "Yaaaay!" to show excitement and tend to claim they are hyper because they eat candy frequently

<div className="horizons-personality">

    <h1>Sisterly</h1>

    <p>Sisterly (アネキ) is a personality type introduced in New Leaf and a starting villager personality in New Horizons. Sisterly villagers are very caring towards the player and are less vain than the snooty or peppy villagers, but they are also more blunt, straightforward, and tomboyish and may come across as rude on some occasions<br/><br/>
    
    Sisterly villagers will, when befriended, give the player fighting tips and teach them ways to relax. These villagers are tough, but still care deeply about their appearance. They have a tendency to stay up very late into the night. They are the least common personality. Even though all sisterly villagers are female, other villagers may sometimes refer to them using male pronouns.
    <br/><br/>
    
    They will treat the player with respect and will even offer to fight off anyone that is giving the player trouble. Sisterly villagers generally get along with peppy, smug, lazy, jock and other sisterly villagers. They don't get along with cranky or snooty villagers.

    </p>

<div className="horizons-personality">

    <h1>Smug</h1>

    <p>Smug (ボク) is a personality introduced in New Leaf. They are very polite, kind, and gentleman-like, and will easily get along with other villagers. They seem to be a mix between all personality types and are lively, kind, and positive, but may come off as conceited. Smug villagers tend to have a bigger ego and talk about how much they're cool most of the time and cooler than everyone else.<br/><br/>

    Smug villagers will also occasionally flirt with the player. There are no female villagers with the Smug trait. They generally get along with peppy, normal, lazy and other smug villagers. They may have trouble getting along with cranky, jock and sisterly villagers, despite the latter being a counterpart of smug villagers.
    
    </p>

</div>

<div className="horizons-personality">

    <h1>Snooty</h1>

    <p>Snooty villagers (オトナ) (sometimes called Snobby) are female characters in the Animal Crossing series. They are called snooty villagers because they act more mature and higher-class than other villagers. They are usually portrayed wearing makeup and high-end clothes that match their style, and their homes appear luxurious, though there are some exceptions.<br/><br/>
    
    Snooty villagers are well-spoken and sometimes appear offensive and rude towards other villagers, including the player. They are self-centered, hot-tempered, and sarcastic, but if the player talks to them often, they open up and become more kind, sometimes giving the player lessons in fashion. However, this doesn't prevent them from making the occasional scathing comment. Snooty villagers usually have exotic or upper-class names, or names relating to high-value items and gemstones, making them easy to distinguish when talking to villagers around town.<br/><br/>

    They will find it difficult to socialize with most villagers, who have conflicting lifestyles to their own. They do not understand how lazy villagers can relax and not worry about their physical appearance. They also cannot fathom how jock villagers exercise or talk about exercising seemingly constantly and not worry about fashion; a jock villager's comment on the snooty villager's fitness will anger them. Normal villagers usually do not get along with them, and on most occasions both villagers criticize each other or the normal villager gets offended by the snooty villager's criticism.<br/><br/>
    
    Peppy villagers sometimes, without knowing, let their ideas come out; for example, a peppy villager may say "You know you're always rude...", leading the snooty villager to leave the conversation annoyed. Sisterly villagers likely won't get along with them, due to snooty villagers' tendency to talk about them behind their backs. They get along with cranky villagers, who share their maturity and viewpoints on life, and smug villagers as well, due to their similar interests in fashion.
